# Friendly Graven's Mutation Mod

Just removes a few things from the mod [Graven's Mutation Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3148171613) by [Gravenwitch](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198196691033/myworkshopfiles/?appid=333640) so that it will play nice with other popular mutation mods.

**Removed:**
Chitin Flesh, Fluffy Feathers, Light Manipulation, Night Vision, Scaly Skin, and Winter Fur.

**Tested with:** [WM Expanded Mutations (Stable Edition)](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2198787801), [Friendly Improved Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3415337918), [Miscellaneous Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3114272414), [Poison/Paralysis/Confusing Fangs Mutations](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3400087527), [Underdark Mutation & Cave Dweller Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1727376332)
